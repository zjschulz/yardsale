# YardSale_App

The creation of this application was inspired by my desire to provide independent crafter's a simple tool other than mainstream marketing services to bridge the "social distancing" issues of 2020 when it comes to needing a place to sell goods to a local community. The application allows a user to sign in, create items, view all items or just their own items, and delete their own items.

## Installation

Place the below line in your terminal

    $ git clone git@github.com:zjschulz/yardsale.git

Open the folder created by the above line.

Redirect to the ./yardsale/yardsale-backend path in the terminal. Run "bundle install" and "rails db:migrate"

## Usage

To initiate my application, type "rails s" whilst in the ./yardsale/yardsale-backend to access the Rails server.

Redirect to the ./yardsale/yardsale-frontend path in the terminal. Type "python3 -m http.server 8000" to initiate a python server on the local environment.

The local environment will now exist at url: http://localhost:8000.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
